                        <div class="ui text container">
                        <p>Heather and Charles met their freshman year at Michigan State University. They were in the same friend group that all lived in the Snyder-Phillips building. Throughout college they became very close as they hung out and shared “chemistry” class together.</p>
                        <p>Senior year they began doing more on their own which led to going on dates. One night, on January 31, 2017, they took a walk through campus, and under Beaumont Tower Charles asked Heather to be his girlfriend! (Rumor has it: In order to prove you are a “true spartan,” and to ensure you marry your sweetheart, you must kiss in either the shadow of the tower or at midnight in the Beaumont courtyard.)</p>
                        <p>That summer, he moved to Jackson for work while she was in school until graduation in December.</p>
                        <p>The next year, Charles was offered a new role in work that took him to Indiana. So, in fall of 2018, they not only moved in together, but did so in another state. They moved to Terre Haute, Indiana.</p>
                        <p>While in Indiana, they went on lots of hikes and camping trips together. Heather even joined Student Painters (the company Charles was working for) and ran the number one branch in the state! That was the last year in the company for them and after the season ended, they took a big trip. In Charles’ tiny Ford Fiesta and their two-person tent, they traveled from Michigan to the east coast. Then back west through Colorado to the other coast and up to Canada. The trip spanned 5 weeks, 25 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and 13 National Parks. It was a LOT of time alone together.</p>
                        <p>Before the trip they planned to move to Maine the next year. After the trip they decided they liked Washington better. But in January 2020, they moved into their apartment in Denver, Colorado.</p>
                        <p>In Denver, they started a company: Your Painters. After two months of living there, the world shut down. So, they spent a LOT of time alone together playing board games and reading.</p>
                        <p>After so many months without productivity, they finally decided to do something about their shared real-estate investing goals. On January 5 th , they got the keys to their first house! 3 days before that, they adopted their first puppy, Violet! And a couple weeks later, on January 30, 2021 Charles proposed on a hike (under Bridal Veil Falls). She said, “Yes, finally!”</p>
